Functions
=========
* Implement function composition
  - affine transformation
- implement interface for Regularized Mirror Descent-type methods that require
  minimizing a regularizer, a prox-function, and a linear term

Optimizers
==========
- implement steepest descent method
- Implement primal-dual interior point solver
- implement primal-dual subgradient descent (or maybe Augmented Lagrangian method?)
- implement Conditional Gradient Descent (aka Frank-Wolfe)

Testing
=======
- implement an example that uses general constraints
- implement an example that uses a ton of function composition.

Constraints
===========
- Add better support inequality constraints. There's gotta be something better
  than a log barrier function.
- add support for finding an initial solution

Stopping Criteria
=================
- Implement some method to check convergence using duality gap

Learning Rates
==============
- implement ADMM step size scheme (ADMM paper, page 20)

General
=======
- added symbolic problem definitions
- implement the following interface

  minimize(<expr>)
    .subject_to(<expr>)
    .subject_to(<expr>)
    .using(<algorithm>)

  where <algorithm> is initialized with all algorithm-specific parameters
- implement Lagrangian from problem definition
